                <li>
                    By renting games for more than 5 hours you agree that you
                    will return the games on the next day by 12:00 pm
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you cancel the order later than 3 days in advance, the
                    prepayment will not be refunded.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By paying for games on the website, you are only booking the
                    games and paying half of the rental fee.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The other half of the payment is due on the day of your
                    event.

                <li>Delivery fee is not included, 15 â‚¾</li>
                <li>
                    If any game components are lost or damaged, you will be
                    required to reimburse the cost of repairs and downtime for
                    the next three days. (In case they are actually booked for 3
                    days.) We hope that you will be as careful as possible with
                    our games! After all, you yourself would like to take the
                    game in your hands &quot;as good as new&quot;.

                    If you need to rent games for several days, just make it out
                    in different orders.

                    After making a prepayment you will receive an e-mail with
                    the listed games and data on how much you have already paid
                    and how much you still need to pay.

                <li>
                    You will be contacted separately regarding delivery and

                <li>
                    It is your responsibility to check the completeness of the
                    games when you receive them.

                    In the event that the games are found to be defective upon
                    return and you do not agree with the initial assessment
                    made, the parties are obliged to try to resolve the dispute
                    by their own efforts respectfully.

                            costs and downtime if the same game is booked for
